INTRODUCTION:
  This Snake game project is developed using Python and incorporates several fundamental programming concepts. The game allows users to choose between different difficulty levels, control the snake using keyboard inputs, and compete for a high score.


FEATURES:

		  1. Difficulty Levels: Easy, medium, and hard options.
	
		  2. Dynamic Gameplay: Snake grows longer as it eats food.
	
		  3. Collision Detection: Game over when the snake hits the wall or itself.
	
		  4. Scoreboard: Keeps track of the score and displays game over message.
		

REQUIREMENTS:
		  Python 3.12.4
		  turtle module (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
		  time module (standard Python library)

  
INSTALLATION:
  Clone the repository:
  
        git clone https://github.com/sabhya1024/SNAKE-GAME---PYTHON.git

		
  Navigate to the project directory:
  
      cd SNAKE-GAME---PYTHON

        
USAGE:
  1. Run the game:
        python main.py
  2. Choose your difficulty level when prompted (easy/medium/hard).
  3. Control the snake using the arrow keys or W, A, S, D.



GAMEPLAY:


  1. STARTING THE GAME:
        Choose a difficulty level.
        The game screen will open with the snake in the center.
      
  2. CONTROLS:
        Up / W: Move Up
        Down / S: Move Down
        Left / A: Move Left
        Right / D: Move Right
      
  
  3. OBJECTIVES:
        Eat the food appearing on the screen to grow longer.
        Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
     
  
  4. GAME OVER:
        When the snake collides with the wall or itself, the game ends.
        A prompt will appear asking if you want to play again.


PYTHON CONCEPTS USED:
  1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes for the snake, food, and scoreboard.
  2. Modules: turtle for graphics, time for game speed control.
  3. Event-Driven Programming: Keyboard controls for snake movement.
  4. Game Logic: Collision detection, score tracking, and game state management.
